# Contributing to AIVP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Value Protocol! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

> ⚠️ **Contribution Status (Current Stage)**
>
> We welcome **discussion through GitHub Issues** at this stage of development.
>
> **External Pull Requests are not currently accepted.** If you have a proposal — bug report, feature idea, specification clarification, or example suggestion — please open an issue describing it. If we agree it adds value, maintainers will implement it and credit you.
>
> This policy may be revisited in the future.

> **Stage Status (v1.0.0)**
>
> AIVP is at early specification stage. The processes below describe the *target* governance model. Initial decisions are made by AIXP Labs core maintainers; community discussion period scales as the contributor base grows.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AIXP-Labs/AIVP/issues) to report bugs, suggest features, or propose specification changes
- For specification changes, use the `spec-change` issue template
- Provide clear descriptions with examples where possible

### Discussion-Driven Development

Instead of submitting PRs directly:

1. **Open an issue** describing your proposal, bug, or idea
2. **Discuss** with maintainers — clarify scope, design, and approach
3. **Wait for review** — significant proposals follow the [Specification Changes](#specification-changes) process below
4. **If accepted**, maintainers will implement the change and credit you in commit/release notes

### Specification Changes

Proposals affecting normative content (anything in `specification/`) follow this process:

1. An issue with the `spec-change` label describing the proposed change
2. A minimum 14-day discussion period for non-trivial changes (target governance model; current discussion windows scale with contributor count)
3. An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `adrs/` for significant decisions
4. Axiom 0 compliance review by maintainers
5. Multi-jurisdiction regulatory review (settlement / contract / payment law for relevant currency zones)
6. Updated documentation reflecting the change
7. **Both EN and CN versions must be updated simultaneously**

### Documentation Changes

Suggestions for non-normative content (guides, topics, reference, examples) are welcome via issues — typo fixes, clarifications, additional examples are particularly valued. Maintainers will implement accepted suggestions, ensuring alignment with Axiom 0 and the Dignity Standard.

## Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Follow the existing document structure and formatting
- All content values must be in human language (no opaque codes or machine-only tokens)
- Default language is English; Chinese translations should follow promptly

### Axiom 0 Compliance

Every contribution must comply with Axiom 0: Human Sovereignty and Wellbeing. Specifically:

- Changes must not weaken human oversight of AI commercial interactions
- Changes must not enable AI agents to circumvent transparency requirements
- Changes must not compromise the Dignity Standard
- Changes must preserve dual-signature requirements for human-authorized commercial actions

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `spec`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `spec(trust): add V4 Premier trust level stake requirements`
- `docs(guide): add USDC settlement walkthrough`
- `fix(spec): correct CONTRACT_PROPOSE message format example`

### Bilingual Requirements

For specification changes:
- English version (`specification/AIVP_Protocol.md`) and Chinese version (`specification/AIVP_Protocol_cn.md`) must be updated in the same PR
- Axiom 0 in Chinese: "人类主权与福祉" (never abbreviated)
- Maintain consistent terminology — refer to `docs/reference/glossary.md`

## Writing Guidelines

### RFC 2119 Keywords

When writing normative specification text, use the keywords defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119):

- **MUST** / **MUST NOT** — Absolute requirements
- **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** — Strong recommendations with documented exceptions
- **MAY** — Truly optional behavior

These keywords MUST be capitalized when used in their normative sense.

### Terminology

- Use "AIVP agent" for governed AI commercial agents
- Use "Trust Level V0–V4" with capitalized V prefix (V0 Stranger, V4 Premier — V for Value/Verified)
- Capitalize "Axiom 0", "Dignity Standard" (proper nouns)
- Currency: use ISO 4217 codes (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, AUD, CHF, SGD, KRW, BRL, MXN, IDR, INR)
- Crypto settlement: use full names ("USDC", "USDT", "DAI"); never abbreviate as "stablecoin" in normative text without context
- Settlement rails: distinguish "fiat rails" (Stripe, Wise, SWIFT, ACH) from "crypto rails" (USDC on Solana, USDT on Tron, etc.)
- AIVP is **international** — never reference PRC-specific channels (Alipay/WeChat); those belong to AIRP

### Document Structure

- Begin each topic document with a one-paragraph introduction
- Use tables for field specifications
- Use code blocks with language annotations for examples
- Use Mermaid diagrams or email transcripts for flow illustrations
- Cross-reference between documents using relative links

### Closing Seal

All specification documents MUST end with:

```

```
